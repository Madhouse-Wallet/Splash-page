# Madhouse Wallet — Brand Guidelines

These guidelines now mandate usage of the supplied raster lockup `logo.png` as the single, official primary logo.

Important: the previously-created SVGs (`logo-mark.svg`, `logo-horizontal.svg`) are deprecated and should not be used in any new materials. If you need vector versions for print or large-format work, request them from the brand team so they can be produced from the approved master artwork.

## Primary logo (required)

- File: `logo.png` (raster lockup provided by the brand owner)

Usage rules:

- Always use the provided `logo.png` as the single source of truth for logos across web pages, marketing, and printed materials.
- Do not recolor, stretch, rotate, or otherwise modify `logo.png`. Any compositing must preserve the logo artwork exactly.

Clear space & minimum size:

- Clear space: maintain a minimum clearspace equal to 25% of the logo height on all sides (measure from the outermost pixel of the logo art).
- Minimum display width: 180 px. For smaller UI elements, request a purpose-built asset from the brand team.

Backgrounds:

- `logo.png` was designed on a white background and is optimized for white or light backgrounds. On dark backgrounds, use a white (reversed) version of the logo. If you need a reversed PNG, request one from the brand team.

File formats & delivery:

- Use `logo.png` (provided) for any system that requires raster images (email, legacy CMS, or raster-only design systems).
- For responsive needs, the brand team will supply `@1x`, `@2x`, and `@3x` raster exports on request.

When NOT to use the raster logo:

- Do not use `logo.png` for applications where a vector is required (large-format print, laser engraving, or any process that needs vector outlines). Instead, request an official vector export from the brand team.

## Color & supporting guidance

- Primary palette still used in brand materials: deep near-black background `#0a0915`, button surface `#252038`, and warm accent `#E2682B` where appropriate.
