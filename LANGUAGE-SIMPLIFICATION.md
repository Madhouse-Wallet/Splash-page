# Language Simplification - User-Facing SEO Content

**Date:** November 28, 2025
**Purpose:** Simplify all user-facing descriptions for ages 21-50, accessibility, and clarity
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Previous meta descriptions and schemas contained:
- ❌ Technical jargon ("fiat currency", "payment processor", "FinCEN")
- ❌ Complex sentences (too long, too formal)
- ❌ Industry terminology (not accessible to general users)
- ❌ Overly detailed disambiguation that confused users

**User Feedback:**
> "Some of the wording in the description of the website in Google do not make clear sense."

---

## ✅ Solution: Plain Language Rewrite

### Guiding Principles

**Target Audience:**
- Ages: 21-50
- Education: General audience (not finance professionals)
- Use case: Small business owners, freelancers, families sending money home
- Tech literacy: Basic to intermediate

**Language Rules:**
1. **Use everyday words** - "Send money" instead of "remittance service"
2. **Short sentences** - Max 20 words per sentence
3. **Active voice** - "Madhouse Wallet helps you" instead of "Services are provided"
4. **Specific examples** - "Cash out to M-Pesa" instead of "local payment methods"
5. **Avoid jargon** - "Real money" instead of "fiat currency"
